8.1: Nothing happens when run is clicked.
8.2: The methods for space load a preset world.
8.3: void act() and double getMass()
8.4: sun: 240
     planet: 4.2
     moon: 0.8
8.6: accelerate(), addToVelocity(), getExactX(), getExactY(), getSpeed(), invertHorizontalVelocity(),
     invertVerticalVelocity(), move(), setLocation().
8.7: setLocation() has two methods, one takes int the other takes double. The method that
     takes doubles can place objects with more precision.
8.9: All of the methods can be called but addToVelocity requires a vector.
8.11: When "this" is removed the local variable mass is set equal to itself and the 
      object's variable of mass is never set resulting in a mass of 0.0, with this.mass 
      it sets the object's variable of mass equal to the value for mass passed in the constructor.
      The code compiles but would not work how its intended.
8.12: The default direction is right and speed is 1.0.
8.13: The bodies all move identically.
8.14: They move down. The direction and speed are set in their constructor when made in the space class.
8.17: Color has 7 constructors.
8.18: The range is 0 to 255.
8.19: Color is imported at the top just under greenfoot.*
8.20: cannot find symbol - class Color.
8.27: sqrt has 1 parameter. It takes and returns a double.
8.28: max(int a, int b)
8.30: The objects orbit each other based on distance and size difference as expected. 
      However in some situations such as the sunPlanetMoon() setup the moon eventually
      hits the planet and causes very erratic movement.
